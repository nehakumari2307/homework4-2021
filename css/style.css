 /* Table elements should have the following styles:
Table cells have centered text with a 2px black border on only one side (the top), and 10px padding on all sides.

Column headers are always at least 125px wide, with 10px of padding. Column header text is white, 
centered horizontally and vertically, and uppercase with a dark red background (#7e0825).

Row headers have a consistent 2px black border.  
Only use the border property on the sides that aren’t touching an existing border. (See example picture.)
Every odd numbered table row has a transparent background.
Every even numbered table row has a grey background (#D1D1D1)
Hovering over a row changes it to the same background color as the column header, but with an alpha transparency of .25 so don’t use hexadecimal.

/* The table
Should be centered on a large screen
Should have a specialized border with:
5px black border around the exterior (provided in starter code).
50px radius rounded exterior corners ** 
The rounded corners are a challenge problem - you are expected to struggle on this component.
It is fine if there is some white space between the border and the table cells at the edge.
HINT: You will need to round the corners of the table AND the corner cells. How can you use pseudeoclasses to make sure the outer cells are rounded no matter how big the table is?   (You need extra code to make sure only the *outside* borders are rounded, not all of the cells.)
